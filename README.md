# Hangman

Variation of the popular classic Hangman game. 


## How it Works:

This Wild West themed Hangman game challenges the player to guess a famous character of the time period without guessing 6 wrong letters.

2. Player then clicks on the letter of choice 
3. Guess which character is the "Mystery Character."
4. By pressing the reset button in the top right corner of the page, or reloading the page, the game will reset. 
```

```
- If a correct letter is guessed, the letter will turn green, move to the correct position in the puzzle, and play a correct sound!
